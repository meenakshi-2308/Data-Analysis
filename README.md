# Data-Analysis

A dataset has been stored in the file fb441e62df2d58994928907a91895ec62c2c42e6cd075c2700843b89.csv. This is the dataset used for this assignment. Note: The data comes from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.

Each row in the datafile corresponds to a single observation.

The following variables are provided:

1) id : station identification code
2) date : date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2012-01-24 = January 24, 2012)
3) element : indicator of element type
    TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
    TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C)
4) value : data value for element (tenths of degrees C)

The notebook contains:

1) Python code which returns a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day is shaded.
2) Overlays a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.
The data been given is near Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States
